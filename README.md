Program that translates from English to Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing.  It obeys a few simple rules (below), but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.
 
 # Rule 1: 
 If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. (e.g. "apple" -> "appleay").
 
 # Rule 2: 
 If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word. (e.g. "car" -> "arcay")

 1. Base case
 "hello" => "ellohay"

 2. Word begins with a vowel
 "apples" => "applesay"

 3. Sentences
 "eat world" => "eatay orldway"
